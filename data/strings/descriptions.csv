COM_HE_Fighter,SHIP,"The T-105 People’s Grav-Fighter represents the Red Horizon Pact’s first mass-produced hover-strike craft, a triumph of collective engineering and proletarian discipline. Designed to be built in overwhelming numbers, the T-105 trades decadent individualist “firepower supremacy” for the virtues of thick, worker-forged armor plating and unyielding “reliability”. When the cowardly Tri-Tachyon capitalists fled Dniprovia, they attempted to scorch the ground behind them—yet the people salvaged an intact experimental gravity-drive core from the ruins. Through the heroic labor of Morozovian scientists, this technology was swiftly integrated into all RHP fighter designs, ensuring that the power of liberated gravity now serves the revolutionary vanguard alone.",,,,,

com_RHP_destription,CUSTOM,"“Nothing can have value without being an object of utility.”
During the darkest hours of the Second AI War, the Hegemony covertly gathered anti–Tri-Tachyon militants—saboteurs, dissidents, and hardline class warriors—and funneled them into Tri-Tachyon space. Among them was the renowned communist revolutionary Ubiystvo Kongxiang, whose uncompromising ideology and strategic brilliance made him a symbol of proletarian resistance.
Upon landing on the industrial world of Morozov, Kongxiang swiftly seized leadership of the planetary communist party and ignited a populist uprising against the Zinoviev System Authorites. The revolution spread with mechanical precision: factories revolted, workers’ militias mobilized, and the old regime collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions. As General Secretary, Kongxiang then launched the “liberation” of the Chunqiao system during the chaos of the Artemisia Sun coup, further expanding the sphere of revolutionary influence. His triumph was cut short when he was assassinated with an icepick—officially by an unknown agent, though the Party chronicles insist it was the work of reactionary elements.
Emerging from this crucible of upheaval, the Red Horizon Pact (RHP) declared itself the rightful vanguard of the Persean worker. Built on the population, industrial might, and ideological rigor of Morozov, the Pact reorganized its territories into a constellation of People’s Republics, each governed by local committees that take direct guidance from the Communist Party of Morozov. Vanguardist communism is enshrined as the sole lawful ideology, and class consciousness is preserved and protected through sealed borders, rigorous political education, and the ever-watchful Main Directorate of Correctional Labour Camps.
The RHP’s economic and military doctrines revolve around the five-cycle plans: aggressive unrelenting expansion of heavy manufacturing. Commissars are embedded within every regiment, ship, and work battalion to ensure ideological purity and unwavering revolutionary spirit. When not deployed for liberation campaigns, the Persean Sector’s People’s Navy participates in the systematic exploitation of Zinoviev’s colossal asteroid belt—save for the elite Gvardiya formations, whose role remains veiled in secrecy.
To the Red Horizon Pact, all non-socialist states are inherently fascist, or inevitably destined to become so, and thus must be “liberated”. The march toward universal proletarian unity is, in their view, not merely an ideological aspiration—it is historical inevitability.
",,,,,
com_Morozov_desc,CUSTOM,"Morozov stands as the frigid heart of the Red Horizon Pact—a world whose relentless cold mirrors the unyielding discipline of its leadership. Towering foundries, armored factory-cities, and continent-spanning labour complexes dominate its surface, forging the material strength of the proletariat without pause.
Through sacrifice and iron will, Morozov has achieved the dubious honor of being the most polluted world in the Persean Sector, its poisoned skies and scarred continents heralded by party propaganda as proof of the people’s uncompromising commitment to socialist victory. Every furnace belch and every armored conveyer line is celebrated as another step toward the universal liberation of all workers.",,,,,
com_Dniprovia_desc,CUSTOM,"Dniprovia was the first planet “liberated” by the Red Horizon Pact, seized in the opening blaze of the Morozovian revolution and refashioned into a model of socialist extraction. Rich in minerals, hydrocarbons, and arable lowlands, the world’s abundant resources are now directed entirely toward fulfilling the Pact’s ambitious Five-Cycle Plans.
Under the strict supervision of Party commissars, Dniprovia’s industries operate without pause, its landscapes reshaped to feed the furnaces and assembly lines of the wider proletarian struggle. The population—kept in a state of engineered scarcity—remains compliant through a mix of ideological discipline and rationing policies designed to break residual bourgeois resistance.
On Dniprovia, every ingot smelted and every mine stripped bare is heralded as a heroic sacrifice for the inevitable triumph of socialism.
",,,,,
com_station_desc,CUSTOM,"The PLSZS was originally constructed by the decadent Tri-Tachyon corporation to strip-mine the Gigantic Zinoviev asteroid belt for private profit. Following its decisive liberation, the station was transformed into the principal dockyard of the Red Horizon Pact, repurposed for the needs of the collective. Today, it continues its vital function as an ore-extraction hub—now operated by disciplined workers’ brigades—and serves as a cornerstone of the Persean People’s Navy, whose steadfast crews embrace their secondary duty as miners in service of the Five-Cycle Industrial Plan.",,,,,
com_binhdo_desc,CUSTOM,"Binhdo is a world of sweltering jungles, crushing humidity, and storm-thrashed oceans—a harsh environment that the Red Horizon Pact proudly declares the perfect forge for its toughest soldiers. For generations, its people have been subjected to exhaustive conscription quotas, supplying wave after wave of infantry to the Pact’s endless campaigns.
Binhdo’s soils have been stripped bare by relentless overfarming conducted in accordance with Party agricultural directives. The land is exhausted, and the population—drained by military levies and subsistence rations—has been left equally depleted.
Yet in official doctrine, this devastation is celebrated as proof of Binhdo’s unwavering devotion: a world whose jungles, fields, and children alike have been offered up to strengthen the Red Horizon’s march toward universal worker’s liberation.

com_marx,SHIP,"The marx class dreadnaughts serve as both powerful point defence battleships and supply production factories. Massive aquaponic farms and two biodomes produce continuous food production for sustained operations. Onboard refineries and industrial lines manufacture spare parts and munitions, allowing the Marx-class to support entire task forces without reliance on rear-area logistics.
In an act of shocking ideological tolerance a fleet of marx class was commissioned by the red horizon pact from mythic manufacturing ,As part of a plan for pan galactic liberation once the Persian sector was secured. Upon delivery of the lead ship, the design was promptly reverse-engineered in the name of the workers, and the remaining contracts were cancelled.
Mythic manufacturing used the marx class initiative as a chance to experiment with dreadnaught design and production. The class suffers from heavy crew requirements, overstressed reactors, poor deck layouts,and engines designed to be slow enough that the mining drones can bring in raw materials for processing. The class only remains in production and service due to their replacement ,the Babeuf class, is stuck in development hell. ",,,,,

A few smugglers and black-market traders use the long, quiet orbit of these stations for drop-points. A dozen corpses and cored shuttle are the not uncommon tell of a deal gone bad.",,,,
,,,"Orbiting megacity, naval yard, and port; the axis of Corvus, swarmed by Starship traffic. Ancient repair gantries skulked between corroded industrial hangars in the shadow of laboratory rings and support modules. Higher still, commercial bays and metroplex districts were shepherded by the C&C spire bristling with weapons pods.",,,,
,,,"Heavy industrial manufacturing relied on great nanoforges recovered from the ruins of the Domain. However their output quality decayed over cycles; nanoscale corruption led to growing macroscopic flaws. Much of the output had to be repaired by cruder methods, and much was scrapped and fed back as the refined feedstock for which the aging forges ever hungered.",,,,

The many deviations of natural planetary environments from the specifications may be corrected through technological intervention including ice-asteroid bombardment, orbital burns, biomodded ecosystems, orbital megastructures, and other methods provided by the EUT.",unlocked,,,

The census of the Persean Sector could be off by as much as an order of magnitude. Imagine!",unlocked,,,
,,,"The people of Chicomoztoc, the majority population of the Persean Sector, lived in vast underground arcologies blasted into the sleeping crust of their world.

A smaller passenger lift filled with the smell of sweat and machine oil as a shift of undersea laborers returned home. Glimpses of the towering arms of Kay-arco appeared for short seconds, glittering with thousands of windows, before being again darkened by a blur of mildewed plating.",unlocked,,,

The Church reigned as a stern gardener, ensuring piety and duty in honoring the ground upon which Ludd once trod.",,,,

Not the wind, but a pilgrim exposed without a haz-suit. And there were others, wearing only light robes amongst the inimical xenolife. Easily overtaken.",,,,
,,,"Monasteries clung to the sublime promontories which ringed the volcanic provinces forced through world-wrapping ice. Unseen were the bunkers, heavy batteries, and missile silos of the Knights of Ludd.

The reigning Presbyter Orbis declared a handful of special economic zones on the shifting floes; these transmitted welcomes, their beacons calling outside traders to port.",,,,

Like a veil, it flexed slowly in the electrostatic field strong enough to overcome the low gravity of the world to hang in near-vacuum.",,,,

""We do not have many visitors, you see,"" the curate said.",,,,
,,,"The steady advance of gendarmerie broke the protest line, shock-prods rose and fell to muffled shouts and silent screaming. Drones, flashing laser-light, deployed restraint foam on struggling forms. Fists, signs, and hand tools were useless against the power-armored officers.",,,,

,,,"Kazeron was rich in exotic metals, the former core of a gas giant blasted away in an ancient celestial catastrophe. Its industrial base, built to feed the Domain's Persean frontier heavy machinery and terraforming plant, was quickly adapted to build a warfleet which gave pause to the XIVth Battlegroup.",,,,

,,,"More than a company town, Ilm was a company world, from the orbital security platforms shining above to the teleoperated mines ripped deep down into the crust. Ruled by a semi-militarized corporate board, the identity of investors was not public information, though the least paranoid speculation favored a mix of League and Tri-Tachyon capital.",,,,
,,,"A vice squad brute stared down all who entered. They could shut the place down at any time, but the teahouse-speakeasy provided a conduit with the commerce required for holy war.

Before long you stood before large doors of etched metal. The militants were met by another pair, similarly armed. The most senior lowered his mask.",,,,

The rain sent nasty rivulets of fluid slithering down conduits to pool on moldy canopies. The sky's feeble light diffused into a flattening murk.",,,,

,,,"It cannot be said to thrive, but the colony of Sentinel gained a new sense of hope and energy after reintegration with the Hegemony.

The citizens were diligent, orderly, and disciplined. It was thought that they would make good officer candidates despite quiet objections from Eventide's old guard.",,,,

To awaken it, to touch the divine, must fall somewhere between sacrilege and sanctification.",,,,
,,,"These were the massive, automated starships which bore the Gates that established near-instantaneous connections between distant stars.
